# Calculator
My first project.
version 1.0 (March 3, 2020) - This calculator takes into account what you can count in your mind) I wanted to do it better, but my knowledge is not enough.
Version 1.2 (March 10, 2020) - I made it better, but there are still a lot of errors in my code. It is necessary to do instructions instead of displaying messages. Also remove the reverse method in the InputBuffer. There you need a loop. In the next version I will try to fix
version 1.3 (March 10, 2020) - added roman numbers. But the answer is Arabic. A lot of errors need to be fixed
